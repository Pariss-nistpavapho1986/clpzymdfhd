OMG, just finished watching Marching Powder, and dude, my brain is all over the place. What even was that ending? Like, how is he just wandering around La Paz without a care in the world? Seriously, that whole prison setup was wild. Cocaine hotel, what the heck?! And the tours?! Can you imagine that being a legit tourist attraction? Smuggler vibes, but make it a vacation stop, right?!

> I swear, how does Thomas get away with this stuff? One minute heâ€™s tryna survive, next, heâ€™s throwing parties. And his love story? So random but also kinda sweet, you know? Like, did anyone see that coming? Pipâ€™s all tough and then bam, theyâ€™re all lovey-dovey in a prison. Never felt the need to download the movie before, but I'm so glad I watched it, lol.

Kinda drained now. Was it just me or did it feel like an adrenaline rush and a drag at the same time? Everythingâ€™s like, super intense, then suddenly youâ€™re watching dudes playing chess. Prison reality shows have nothing on this. Oh, when he did that whole escape attempt, bro, I thought it was gonna turn into another season of Prison Break or something. Glad I just decided to watch the movie with you today.

Anyway, low-key wanna know what Thomas is up to IRL these days. Still slinging stories? Haha. Honestly, will I ever look at gummy bears the same way again after that scene? Doubt it.

const notRelevant = why am I even typing this;

So yeah man, that was like, a whole trip in two hours. Wanna catch up and chat more tomorrow? Let's debrief, lol. Time to crash now. Peace! ðŸ›ŒðŸ˜´
